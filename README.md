# Text-Generation-Using-VAE


Generative models such as GAN and VAE were used on the MNIST dataset to generate new images of handwritten digits. By training a generative model on the dataset, the model can learn the underlying patterns and features. Once trained, it can create new images of handwritten digits that resemble the original dataset. This is useful for tasks such as data augmentation or generating synthetic data for training other machine learning models.
